Microsoft_Malware_Prediction_using_classical_machine_learning_algorithms
This repository contains solution for the topic which I have selected as part of case study using classical machine learning algorithms to solve problem on predicting probability for whether a machine will be soon hit by malware, topic selected from kaggle.

1. Problem Description:
Malware attacks are one of the rising concerns in terms of security and integrity of data for the users and organizations using Windows systems. According to NetMarketShare firm(source Wikipedia), as per their survey on desktop os market share in September 2019, Microsoft Windows OS rules the market by 87%, so here comes the biggest challenge for Microsoft to provide antivirus defender or other security products which provides accurate and efficient results whether machine will be infected with malware or not to keep their data secured and remain non-vulnerable from such kind of attacks.

Main agenda of this problem is to come up with a ML technique which can be able to predict the probability for a machine to be likely infected from malware.

2. Performance metrics:
For checking the performance of model, I had used area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed label. And achieved 0.89 validation AUC score for the best selected model.

3. Solution Description:
To solve this problem I had implemented 2 models and compared their performance based on AUC score and selected the best model to be used on test data to predict the final probabilities.

Model 1 : First I implemented KNN,Logistic Regression,Random Forest,Decision Trees,Light GBM as Baseline Models
Then I implemented Lightgbm model on train dataset and hypertuned its hyperparameters using optuna library.

4. Data:
Dataset can be found from https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data which consist of both train dataset with class labels and test dataset

5. Hardware:
Because of huge dataset for training purpose and computation limitations, deployed my own jupyter server on Google cloud platform with below specs:

8 vCPUs
64 GB RAM
6. Libraries:
Below libraries used for solving this problem

numpy
pandas
dask
phik (library for finding correlation amongst the features)
scipy
lightgbm
scikit learn library of various classifiers
optuna (for hyperparameter tuning)
xgboost
And many more
